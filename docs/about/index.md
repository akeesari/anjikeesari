## Building the Future of Cloud Computing

I'm **Anji Keesari**, a Cloud Architect and technology leader with over 23 years of experience transforming how organizations build and operate in the cloud. Currently based in San Ramon, California, I combine deep technical expertise in Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, AI/ML, and Infrastructure as Code with a passion for innovation, team empowerment, and driving industry-wide change through knowledge sharing.

What excites me most is not just building infrastructure, but reimagining how technology can solve complex business challenges, mentoring teams to reach their full potential, and exploring emerging paradigms like AI agents and intelligent automation that will shape the next decade of cloud computing.

## Professional Philosophy

> "The best architectures solve today's problems while preparing for tomorrow's opportunities. But technical excellence alone isn't enough—I believe in multiplying impact by sharing what I learn freely. Every tutorial I write, every pattern I document, and every engineer I mentor creates ripples that extend far beyond any single project. That's how we advance not just our careers, but our entire field."

## Beyond Technology

During free time, I find joy in playing soccer, hiking through California trails, exploring new places, and most importantly, spending quality time with family and loved ones. These activities provide balance and fresh perspectives that fuel creativity in problem-solving.
