# Download & install Software in Windows OS

## Introduction

In this article, I am going to present a comprehensive list of essential tools and software commonly needed by developers in the IT industry. If you are using Window operating system, you can download and install the following software as per your requirements. It is recommended to use the choco tool for installation, but if you encounter any issues, you can also perform a direct install.

!!! note
    Restart your computer when prompted or needed and also restart your terminal for every install before validate it.

## Install Chocolatey

We will be using Chocolatey commands to install all the required software and developer tools.

**What is Chocolatey?**

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that enables you to install, upgrade, and manage software packages from the command line.

It is strongly recommended to use choco commands for searching and installing the required software instead of attempting manual installations using the provided links.

To use Chocolatey, you will need to have Windows PowerShell installed on your system. You can then install Chocolatey using a PowerShell command, and use it to install and manage packages from the command line.

**Install Chocolatey**

This is the first step you need to take before installing anything on the Windows OS.

To install Chocolatey on your Windows system, open a terminal window (such as PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run as **Administrator** with the following command:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Reference - [https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup)
