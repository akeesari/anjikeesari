# Developer Workstation Configuration

Here are some general recommendations for a developer workstation; However, you can build on your own workstation if you are expert on computer hardware:

- A fast processor with multiple cores (e.g. Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen)
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB or more is recommended for larger projects)
- A solid-state drive (SSD) for the operating system and frequently-used files
- A larger hard drive (HDD) for storing project files and data
- A high-resolution dual monitors with good color accuracy
- A comfortable and ergonomic keyboard and mouse
- A modern operating system (e.g. Windows 10, macOS, or a Linux distribution)
- A development environment or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for the programming languages and frameworks being used
- Any necessary tools and libraries for the developer's projects - will be explained in the next topic
- A version control system (e.g. Git) for managing code
  
It's also important for a developer workstation to have good connectivity and a reliable internet connection, as developers often need to access online resources and collaborate with other team members.
