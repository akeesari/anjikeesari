# Introduction

Welcome to my personal knowledge-sharing platform!

This website brings together years of my hands-on experience, continuous learning, and teaching across modern cloud-native technologies. It is created for developers, architects, and learners who aim to build reliable, production-grade solutions using today's most relevant tools and technologies.

This site is organized with the following topics:

## Developer Tools

This section focuses on helping you set up your local development environment quickly and efficiently, covering both [Windows](software/windows.md) and [macOS](software/mac.md) operating systems. It includes:

* **Download & Install Software** – Step-by-step installation guides for essential developer tools on [Windows](software/windows.md) and [macOS](software/mac.md).
* **Developer Workstation Configuration** – Best practices for setting up a clean, powerful development environment.
* **Useful Tools** – A list of [network related tools](tools/useful-tools.md) that enhance developer productivity.
* **Cheat Sheets** – A collection of clear, quick-reference guides for common technologies:

  * [Git](cheatsheets/git-cheat-sheet.md), [Docker](cheatsheets/docker-cheat-sheet.md), [Dockerfile](cheatsheets/dockerfile-cheat-sheet.md), [Kubectl](cheatsheets/kubectl-cheat-sheet.md), [Helm](cheatsheets/helm-cheat-sheet.md), [ArgoCD](cheatsheets/argocd-cheat-sheet.md), [Azure CLI](cheatsheets/az-cli-cheat-sheet.md), [ACR](cheatsheets/az-acr-cheat-sheet.md), [Terraform](cheatsheets/terraform-cheat-sheet.md), [Redis](cheatsheets/redis-cheat-sheet.md), and more.

* **AI Engineering** – [AI concepts](ai-engineering/ai-concepts.md), [learning roadmaps](ai-engineering/ai-learning-roadmap.md), and [technology stack](ai-engineering/ai-technology-stack.md) for AI/ML development.
