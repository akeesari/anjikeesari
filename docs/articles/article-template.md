# **How to Configure Monitoring Alerts in Azure Application Insights When Exceptions Occur in Any Web Application**

In today's fast-paced world of cloud computing, proactive monitoring and alerting are critical for maintaining the reliability and performance of web applications hosted on Azure. Azure Application Insights provides powerful monitoring and telemetry capabilities, allowing you to gain insights into your application's behavior and health. In this article, we will guide you through the process of configuring monitoring alerts in Azure Application Insights specifically for exceptions that occur in any web application.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. An Azure account with an active subscription.
2. A web application hosted on Azure that is already configured to send telemetry data to Azure Application Insights.

## **Step 1: Access Azure Application Insights**

1. Log in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).

2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Resource groups" and select the resource group containing your web application and Application Insights instance.

3. Click on your Application Insights resource to open its overview.

## **Step 2: Create a New Alert Rule**

1. In the Application Insights overview page, select the "Alerts" section from the left menu.

2. Click the "+ New alert rule" button to create a new alert rule.

## **Step 3: Configure Alert Rule Details**

1. In the "Basics" tab of the alert rule creation wizard, provide a **Name** and **Description** for your alert rule.

2. Under **Resource**, select the web application associated with the Application Insights instance you're monitoring.

3. For the **Condition**, click on the "Add condition" button.

4. In the condition configuration:

   - Choose "Custom log search" as the signal type.
   - Configure the query to filter exceptions. For example, you can use the following query to detect exceptions:
     ```
     exceptions
     | where type == "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web.Exceptions.HandledException"
     ```

5. Set the **Aggregation type** to "Count."

6. Define the **Threshold value** that will trigger the alert. For example, if you want to be alerted when there are more than 5 exceptions in a 5-minute window, set the threshold to 5.

7. Set the **Operator** to "Greater than."

8. Configure the **Severity** and **Alert logic** according to your requirements.

9. Click "Done" to save the condition.

## **Step 4: Configure Action Groups**

1. In the "Action groups" section, click the "Select action groups" dropdown, and then click on "+ New action group" to create a new action group.

2. Provide a **Name** and **Short name** for your action group.

3. Under **Actions**, click on "+ Add action," and select the type of action to be taken when the alert fires. You can choose from various options like sending an email, triggering a webhook, or running a Logic App.

4. Configure the action details according to your preferences.

5. Click "OK" to save the action group.

## **Step 5: Define Alert Details**

1. In the "Alert details" section, specify a **Name** for your alert instance.

2. Set the **Severity** based on the criticality of the alert.

3. Configure the **Action group** by selecting the action group you created earlier.

## **Step 6: Review and Create**

1. Review all the configurations to ensure they are accurate.

2. Click "Create alert rule" to create the alert rule.

## **Step 7: Testing and Validation**

It's essential to test your alert rule to ensure it triggers as expected. To do this, you can deliberately introduce exceptions into your web application and monitor the Azure Application Insights interface for alerts.

## **Conclusion**

Configuring monitoring alerts in Azure Application Insights for exceptions in web applications is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability and performance of your applications. By following the steps outlined in this article, Azure Cloud Engineers can proactively detect and respond to exceptions, minimizing downtime and enhancing the user experience.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your alert rules as your application evolves and usage patterns change, ensuring that your monitoring and alerting strategy remains effective in the long run.
