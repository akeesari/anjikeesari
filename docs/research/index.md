### AI-Driven Algorithmic Trading: Integrating Machine Learning, Hybrid Technical Indicators, and Risk Management for Momentum Strategies

**Journal:** International Journal of Engineering and Computer Science (IJECS)  
**Volume:** Vol. 14 No. 11 (2025) | **Published:** November 24, 2025  
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.18535/ijecs.v14i11.5335

**Research Contribution:**  
Novel integration of supervised machine learning with hybrid technical indicators (VWAP, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) and dynamic risk management for momentum trading. Demonstrates 14% higher returns and 7% lower drawdown compared to conventional rule-based approaches, with Sharpe ratio improvement from 0.8 to 1.7.

**Key Innovations:**
- Sub-second latency trading system with 67% accuracy (vs. 54% baseline)
- Momentum-specific signal fusion with adaptive weighting
- Integrated real-time risk management with momentum-aware controls
- Comprehensive data validation across multiple market data providers

**Keywords:** Algorithmic trading, machine learning, momentum trading, technical indicators, risk management, hybrid signals, real-time systems, VWAP, artificial intelligence, quantitative finance
